What is socket programming? repository. 

This is a multi-client chat application built using Java and socket programming. The project allows multiple clients to connect to a single 
server, exchange messages in real-time, and simulate real-world network communication principles. The application serves 
as a foundation for learning and experimenting with network programming concepts, such as sockets, threads, and client-server architecture.
